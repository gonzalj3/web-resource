# Web Development Resource

Welcome to Hatchways' Web Development Resource, a repo dedicated to collect common web knowledge questions and answers. We hope this resource will benefit developers who are prepping for interviews, and developers who are just looking to learn something new!

**Note:** While some topics are short answers, keep in mind these topics are meant to be led into discussions.

## Topics

- [General](general.md)
- [CSS](css.md)
- [Webpack](webpack.md)

## Contributions

Please feel free to contribute to this repo by submitting PRs. We are opened to new content, fixes (typos, misinformation, etc.) and improvements.
